#  Do not modify this file.
#  It will be replaced with new release of Cucumber+

#  You can customize cucumber parameters by adding files
#    -> cucumber+.properties : content will be merged with default settings
#    -> cucumber+.css : content will replace default css

#  If you need specific properties or css for aspecific features,
#  You can also add other '.cucumber+' folder closer to your features :
#
#    Cucumber+ is looking for its configuration folder, first into your feature's
#    folder, or if not found, it will go recursivly to parent's folder until it
#    will find it. If classpath root folder is reached, then Cucumber+ will stop
#    searching. If no folder was found, it will recreate a default configuration
#    folder.

#  About those parameters :
#    There are three specific keyworks that will be replaces at runtime :
#    now(), counter(page) and counter(pages)
